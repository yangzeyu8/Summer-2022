# Summer 2022

In Summer 2022, I will make some contributions supervised by Prof. Joe Warren to make COMP 665 better. Specifically, I will do the following:

- Design a bonus project about neural networks.
- Research on improving the machine grader by using explainable machine learning algorithms.

Why do I want to make contributions?

- I think COMP 665 is well designed. The instructions are very detailed (the most detailed in all classes). It will be interesting to make this class better.
- It has educational value for me. I think this experience will help me become a better programmer, researcher, and collaborator. Also, it will align with my degree plan and career plan in the long term.

- COMP 665 - DATA VISUALIZATION
- COMP 680 - STATISTICS FOR COMPUTING AND DATA SCIENCE

Spring 22

- COMP 540 - STATISTICAL MACHINE LEARNING
- COMP 553 - BIG DATA MANAGEMENT FOR DATA SCIENCE
- COMP 631 - INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
- COMP 642 - MACHINE LEARNING
- COMP 646 - DEEP LEARNING FOR VISION AND LANGUAGE

Fall 22 (I want to select three courses this semester)

- COMP 549 - APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS
- COMP 550 - ALGORITHMIC ROBOTICS
- TBA

Spring 23 (Graduate after this semester)

- COMP 590 - COMPUTER SCIENCE PROJECTS

## My career plan

Undergraduate

- I major in Electrical Engineering in my undergraduate school. Unfortunately, I only remember math classes, including Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Probability.
- I participated in a research project in optimization for smart energy systems.

MDS

- I want to be well prepared to pursue my PhD. If I am well prepared, I guess I can get a PhD degree in a short time. 
- I want to be good at math because I want to be efficient. Technology changes over time, but math is always there.
- I want to have an analytical mind and research thinking.
- I want to do some machine learning and AI, or maybe others.

PhD degree (possibility 1)

- I want to do valuable research, like discovering the light shining into the cave.

Get a job (possibility 2)

- It is possible to be rejected by all universities in 2023. If it happens (hopefully not), I want to find a job with a small workload although less money, so it affects my learning as least as possible. Then I want to reapply and try to go to graduate school in 2024.
