# Summer 2022

In Summer 2022, I will make some contributions supervised by Prof. Joe Warren to make COMP 665 better. Specifically, I will do the following:

- Design a bonus project about neural networks.
- Conduct research on improving the machine grader by using explainable machine learning algorithms.
