# Summer 2022

In Summer 2022, I will make some contributions supervised by Prof. Joe Warren to make COMP 665 better.  

## [Project 15 - Deep neural networks](https://github.com/yangzeyu8/Summer-2022/tree/main/Project%2015%20-%20Deep%20neural%20networks)

## Research - Machine grader

### Learning with fewer labeled examples

1) Data augmentation
2) Transfer learning
3) Semi-supervised learning
4) Active learning
5) Meta-learning
6) Few-shot learning
7) Weakly supervised learning

### Machine learning with graphs
